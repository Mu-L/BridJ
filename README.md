[BridJ](http://bridj.googlecode.com) is a Java / native interoperability library that focuses on speed and ease of use.

It is similar in spirit to [JNA](https://github.com/twall/jna) (dynamic bindings that don't require any native compilation, unlike JNI), but was designed to support C++, to be blazing fast (thanks to [dyncall](http://dyncall.org) + hand-optimized assembly tweaks) and to use modern Java features.

A comprehensive documentation is available on its [Wiki](https://code.google.com/p/bridj/wiki/FAQ?tm=6) (needs migration to GitHub Pages!).

It was previously hosted on [ochafik/nativelibs4java](http://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java).

# TODO

* Rebuild for Android, cmake-style
* Factor some cruft into cmake helpers
* CI w/ all the cross builds (use upload / download artefact github actions)
* ~~Separate ARM / x86_64 builds on Darwin (link w/ ARM JDK https://jdk.java.net/archive/), or scripting to create fat libjvm.dylib and libjawt.dylib~~
* Update pom to make it independent from nativelibs4java-parent
* Update deps: ASM 5.x, JUnit 4.11
* Fix BridJ's armhf support
